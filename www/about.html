    <h2>GTagHD</h2>
    <p>GTagHD (p<b>GTag</b> <b>H</b>omology <b>D</b>esigner) is a tool for designing olionucleotides for use with the <i>GeneWeld</i> protocol. GeneWeld is a methodology for generating highly precise and efficent targeted integration. GeneWeld has been validated in zebrafish, pig fibroblast, and human cells.</p>
    
    <p>GTagHD is designed to facilitate the use of the GeneWeld technology (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/431627" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1101/431627</a>), which offers several advantages over published approaches.</p>
    <p>These advantages include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GeneWeld requires much shorter regions of homology than other methods (e.g., some methods require several hundred base pairs in double-cut donors as an optimal homology arm length; GeneWeld requires only 48 bp).</li>
      <li>GeneWeld generates precise knock-ins with much higher efficiency than published methods, including germline transmission rates of 50% in zebrafish.</li>
      <li>GeneWeld appears to rely on homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) , single-strand annealing (SSA), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), or another SSA/MMEJ-like pathway, rather than homology-directed repair (HDR), thus it does not require manipulation of cell cycle regulators to achieve enhanced efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>GeneWeld is a technology for easily and efficiently integrating plasmid cargos into a genomic target. We have developed two plasmid series for use with GeneWeld (pGTag and pPRISM), which have a variety of features and reporters. We also have several new plasmid series under active development.</p>

    <p>GeneWeld plasmids are available at <a href="https://www.addgene.org/Jeffrey_Essner/" target="_blank">AddGene</a> as they are developed.</p>

    <p>GTagHD pulls surrounding sequence context from the targeted genomic integration site (green and blue sequence), and processes this information to generate ready-to-order oligonucleotides which can be cloned into a plasmid vector to flank the plasmid cargo of interest. When the plasmid and genomic locus are cleaved by nucleases, the homology between the cargo and the genomic locus allows a DNA repair mechanism to precisely and efficiently knock-in the cargo. While the exact mechanism of GeneWeld integration is currently unknown, we refer to the repair as "homology-mediated end joining" (HMEJ), as it is believed to be microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), single-strand annealing (SSA), or an MMEJ/SSA-like pathway.</p>
      
      <p>GTagHD, GeneWeld, and the pGTag and pPRISM plasmid series were created by the Iowa State/Mayo Clinic Alliance for Genome Engineering.</p>
